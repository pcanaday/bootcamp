    <title>My Teaching Hobby</title>

      My name is Paula Canaday and I teach Coding & Advanced Programming
      courses at Bridging Communities. I also facilitate instruction for
      students to gain work-ready skills in Microsoft Office Applications
      and computer Technology. I have taught in the public school system
      for 15 years and have been at Bridging Communities since its opening
       in 2012. I am blessed to teach alongside dedicated and wonderful
       teachers, but most importantly to have such a mature, well-mannered,
        and ambitions group of students enrolled in my classes each year from
         all six participating school districts. It is a pleasure to greet,
          teach, and learn from such a stellar group.

      I have lived in New Kent County for more than 24 years; however, I am a
       King and Queen native. I have two daughters and one grandson whom I love
        spending time with. I spend my spare time operating my home-based
         printing and embroidery business.

      As a career switcher, I enjoy teaching, mostly because I get to perform
       my favorite hobbies as I work. I also enjoy teaching the students
        critical thinking and problem solving skills that will be useful for
         the rest of their lives regardless of their career path. Each year,
          one or more of my students earn first, second, and/or third place
           state championships in Microsoft Office. The first place winner
            receives an all-expenses paid trip to Orlando Florida to compete
             in the National Championships. I have been blessed to travel along
              with my students for four consecutive years. In 2014, one of my
               students won the National Championship and received all-expenses
                paid trip to Anaheim, California to complete in the World
                 Championship where he placed 5th in his category.

      I am looking forward to another great, highly motivated and competitive
       year with an awesome group of students!
